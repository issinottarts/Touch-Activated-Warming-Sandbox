# Touch-Activated-Warming-Sandbox
Interactive sandbox such that the sand warms to the touch.

This repository consists of the Arduino code, circuit, and images of the design and prototype for a touch-activated warming sandbox.
  
The sand in the sandbox gently warms the area in contact with skin through areas of copper lining. The simple concept is to induce nostalgia by simulating touching sand warmed by the sun. Placed in a gallery setting this work will bring lively memories to a sometimes stark and chilled environment.
